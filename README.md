# Shooting Form Tracker

This project uses **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** to track a basketball player’s body position and shooting motion in real time, along with live detection of the basketball. It provides a side-by-side display of the **live camera feed** and a **3D mannequin simulation**, helping players analyze the angle made with their right elbow.

## Features
- **Full-body tracking** using MediaPipe Pose Estimation
- **Basketball detection** using HSV color filtering (tuned for orange tones)  
- **3D mannequin visualization** showing limbs and posture  
- **Automatic elbow angle calculation** for shooting form analysis  
- **Side-by-side view** of live video and simulated pose

## Future Use
This serves as the base for a larger project which I am working on. By tracking player shooting form, athletes can find different characteristics which lead them to shooting better or worse.
